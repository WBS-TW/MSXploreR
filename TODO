TODO

- Add another button to send selected fragments to Metfrag OR copy the fragments in format to directly copy to Metfrag.
- Find way to extract MS1 peaks in spectrum and calculate Pearson correlation or cosine score with MS2 diagnostic ions within a selected time window. 
Only top "n"" hits will be shown.
- Sync the two plots at x-axis (same retention time scale during zooming). Put to sync buttons on left panel to sync either first or second plots.
